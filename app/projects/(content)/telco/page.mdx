# 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn patterns for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify factors that influence customer retention and present those insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

---

# 2. Objectives & Questions

- **Primary objective:** Identify key drivers of churn and present actionable insights to reduce churn.
- **Guiding questions:**
  - What is the overall churn rate?
  - Which segments (by contract, payment method, service type) are most likely to churn?
  - How do tenure and charges relate to churn?
  - What business actions can reduce churn?

---

# 3. Data Description

- **Source:** Telco Customer Churn dataset (public / Kaggle / IBM sample).
- **Size:** ~7,000 customer records (typical dataset size).
- **Format:** Structured CSV (customer demographics, services, account & billing).
- **Target:** `Churn` (Yes/No).
- **Limitations:** Some `TotalCharges` values may require cleaning (e.g., stored as strings), possible class imbalance between churn and non-churn.

---

# 4. Approach & Methodology

1. **Data cleaning**
   - Convert `TotalCharges` to numeric, handle missing or erroneous values.
   - Standardize categorical values and remove duplicates if present.
2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics for numeric features (tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges).
   - Frequency and cross-tabulations for categorical features (Contract, PaymentMethod, InternetService).
3. **Visualization**
   - Create an interactive Tableau dashboard showcasing churn KPIs, bar/stack charts, and filters.
4. **Interpretation**
   - Highlight actionable insights and recommended next steps for business teams.

# 5. Statistical Tools & Techniques

- Descriptive statistics and cross-tabulation.
- Correlation / association checks between features and churn.
- Visualization-driven pattern discovery (Tableau).
- (Optional next step) Predictive modeling: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, XGBoost; evaluate with ROC, precision/recall, F1-score.

---

# 6. Key Findings (summary)

- **Month-to-month contract** customers show the highest churn rates â€” short-term contracts are a major risk factor.
- **Electronic check** payment method correlates with higher churn compared to other payment methods.
- **Fiber optic** internet users have higher churn than DSL users in this dataset.
- Greater **tenure** correlates strongly with reduced churn (loyalty effect).

---

# 7. Conclusions & Recommendations

- Prioritize retention interventions for month-to-month customers (special offers, loyalty incentives).
- Investigate friction in electronic check payments and consider outreach or alternative incentives.
- Explore customer experience for fiber optic users to understand causes (support, outages, pricing).
- Build a predictive churn model to enable proactive retention campaigns.
