**US Debt Tracker** is an Excel-based data analysis project created to explore and visualize trends in the United Statesâ€™ public and governmental debt.  
The project simulates a real-world scenario where a debt analytics agency in Washington D.C. was tasked by the U.S. Government to provide insights on historical and projected debt patterns.

The analysis focused on answering key questions about the **yearly debt percentage increase**, **monthly historical trends**, and **future projections** of publicly held debt.

## Scenario

You were hired by a small debt agency in Washington, D.C. that specializes in analyzing and forecasting public and private debt.  
The **U.S. Government** has requested an in-depth analysis of public and intergovernmental debt to answer the following questions:

1. What was the yearly debt percentage increase for each year compared to the previous year?
2. Which months historically have seen the highest and lowest increases in total debt?
3. What is the projected growth of the publicly held debt in the next few years?

---

## Tools & Techniques

- **Microsoft Excel** for data cleaning, formula-based calculations, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables** and **Charts** for aggregating and analyzing patterns.
- **Scenario-based analysis** for data interpretation and storytelling.
- **Data Visualization Techniques** including:
  - Line charts for year-over-year growth.
  - Bar charts for monthly averages.
  - Area charts for future projections.

---

## Data Preparation

The project utilized historical U.S. debt data containing:

- **Debt Held by the Public**
- **Intragovernmental Holdings**
- **Total Public Debt Outstanding**

Steps taken:

1. Cleaned and structured raw data to ensure consistency across years.
2. Calculated **year-over-year percentage changes** for each debt category.
3. Summarized **monthly debt averages** to identify historical seasonal patterns.
4. Modeled and visualized **projected debt growth** from 1997â€“2027.

## Key Insights & Visuals

### ðŸ“ˆ Yearly Debt Percentage Increase

- Between **2016â€“2019**, the **average increase** in Total Public Debt Outstanding was **around 5%**.
- A **significant spike in 2020** was observed, primarily due to **pandemic-related economic responses**.

### ðŸ“Š Monthly Historical Debt Trends

- **Highest increases** occurred during **January, February, November, and December**, aligning with **holiday and spending seasons**.
- **Lowest increases** were seen in **April, May, June, and July**, corresponding to periods with fewer major economic activities.
- Hypothesis: Consumer spending and government fiscal behavior around holidays contribute to these fluctuations.

### ðŸŒŽ Projected Publicly Held Debt

- From **1997â€“2007**, debt increased by approximately **$4 trillion**.
- From **2008â€“2019**, debt rose from **$10 trillion to $23 trillion**.
- From **2020â€“2022**, debt grew from **$27 trillion to $31 trillion**.
- Projections show that by **2027**, publicly held debt will approach **$40 trillion**.
- The overall trend suggests **steady and accelerated growth**, influenced by policy, inflation, and economic cycles.

## Final Output

The final Excel dashboard presents:

- **Line Chart**: Yearly Debt Percentage Increase
- **Bar Chart**: Monthly Average Total Debts
- **Area Chart**: Projected Publicly Held Debt

Each chart is accompanied by written summaries and conclusions for interpretability.

---

## Conclusions

- The United States has experienced a **consistent upward trend** in both public and governmental debt.
- The **pandemic year (2020)** marked a sharp deviation due to emergency spending.
- Debt accumulation patterns correlate strongly with **economic cycles and consumer behavior**.
- **Projections indicate continued growth**, highlighting the need for fiscal management and policy intervention.

## Future Work

Potential areas to expand this analysis:

- Integrate **macroeconomic indicators** such as unemployment, inflation, and GDP.
- Automate projections using **Excel forecasting models** or **Python integration**.
- Compare debt trends across countries for a **global economic perspective**.
